### Project Name:
ML-Based Financial Fraud & Phishing Detection System

### Project Description:
This project is a Machine Learning–based cybersecurity solution designed to detect **credit card fraudulent transactions** and **phishing URLs** through a unified web platform. With the rapid growth of digital payments and online banking, financial cybercrimes are increasing significantly. According to reports from Reserve Bank of India, digital payment fraud cases continue to rise each year. Our system provides a dual-layer protection mechanism — preventing phishing attacks and detecting fraudulent financial transactions in real time.

The credit card fraud detection module is built using a dataset from Kaggle and implements Machine Learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Since fraud datasets are highly imbalanced, special focus was given to evaluation metrics like Recall and F1-score to ensure effective fraud detection. The phishing detection module analyzes URL structures and suspicious patterns to classify websites as legitimate or malicious. Both modules are integrated into a Streamlit-based web interface for real-time prediction.

This project demonstrates the practical application of Machine Learning in cybersecurity and FinTech. By combining phishing prevention with transaction fraud detection, the system offers a scalable and comprehensive solution that can be deployed by banks, e-commerce platforms, and financial institutions to enhance digital security.
