# 🏆 HackVerse - Team Repository

Welcome to your official team repository! This is your workspace for the duration of the hackathon. Please read the rules and evaluation guidelines carefully before you begin coding.

## Hackathon Rules & Evaluation Process

To ensure fairness and track your progress, this hackathon features a strict two-phase evaluation process. **You must push your code to this repository to be evaluated.** Code residing only on your local machines will not be graded.

### Evaluation 1: The Midpoint Check
* **Deadline:** 12:15 PM
* **Requirement:** You must have your initial project structure and foundational code pushed to the `main` branch. 
* **Purpose:** This check ensures your team is on track, actively collaborating, and has a viable concept in motion. Mentors/Judges will review your commit history and current progress.

### Evaluation 2: The Final Submission
* **Deadline:** 5:00 PM
* **Requirement:** Your completed project must be fully pushed to the `main` branch. 
* **Purpose:** This is the final version of your project that will be judged for the hackathon prizes.

### STRICT CODE FREEZE POLICY
**No modifications will be accepted after the Development Time ends at 5:00 PM.** Exactly at the deadline, all team repositories will be **Archived** and converted to **Read-Only**. 
* Any unpushed local commits will be lost and cannot be submitted.
* Late submissions, pull requests, or requests to add "just one last fix" will not be accepted under any circumstances.
* **Tip:** Push your code frequently! Do not wait until the last 5 minutes to push your entire project.

### Project Name:
ML-Based Financial Fraud & Phishing Detection System

### Project Description:
This project is a Machine Learning–based cybersecurity solution designed to detect **credit card fraudulent transactions** and **phishing URLs** through a unified web platform. With the rapid growth of digital payments and online banking, financial cybercrimes are increasing significantly. According to reports from Reserve Bank of India, digital payment fraud cases continue to rise each year. Our system provides a dual-layer protection mechanism — preventing phishing attacks and detecting fraudulent financial transactions in real time.

The credit card fraud detection module is built using a dataset from Kaggle and implements Machine Learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Since fraud datasets are highly imbalanced, special focus was given to evaluation metrics like Recall and F1-score to ensure effective fraud detection. The phishing detection module analyzes URL structures and suspicious patterns to classify websites as legitimate or malicious. Both modules are integrated into a Streamlit-based web interface for real-time prediction.

This project demonstrates the practical application of Machine Learning in cybersecurity and FinTech. By combining phishing prevention with transaction fraud detection, the system offers a scalable and comprehensive solution that can be deployed by banks, e-commerce platforms, and financial institutions to enhance digital security.
